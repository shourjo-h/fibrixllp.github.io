      <p>You may request cancellation of your broadband service under the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Within 7 Days of Activation (Cooling Period):</strong> If you are unsatisfied with the service within the first 7 days of activation, you may cancel and receive a refund of the subscription fee, minus a proportional charge for the days used and any installation costs incurred.</li>
        <li><strong>After 7 Days:</strong> Cancellation requests made after the 7-day cooling period will be processed, but <strong>no refund</strong> will be issued for broadband services. The service will be terminated upon processing of the cancellation request.</li>
        <li><strong>Advance / Quarterly / Annual Plans:</strong> If you've prepaid for a quarterly or annual plan and wish to cancel after the 7-day cooling period, <strong>no refund</strong> will be issued. The service will be terminated upon processing of the cancellation request.</li>
